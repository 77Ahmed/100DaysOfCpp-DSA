# 📘 Day 1: Flowchart & Pseudocode

## 🧠 What We Learned

### ✅ What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a visual way to represent the flow of a program or logic.

- Uses **shapes** like rectangles, diamonds, ovals
- Easy to understand — even for non-programmers
- Helps plan logic before coding

### 🧩 Common Flowchart Symbols

| Symbol        | Meaning                      |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| 🟢 Oval        | Start or End of program      |
| 🟦 Rectangle   | Process or action            |
| 🔷 Diamond     | Decision (if/else, condition)|
| ➡️ Arrow       | Flow direction               |

### ✅ What is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode** is writing the logic of your code in plain English (or simple steps).

- Not real code, just structured steps
- Focuses on **logic, not syntax**
- Good for beginners to plan before coding

### 🧾 Example: Check if number is positive or negative

**Pseudocode:**

Start  
Input number  
If number > 0  
Print "Positive"  
Else  
Print "Negative"  
End

### 💡 Tip for Beginners

> Don’t jump into code immediately. Use flowcharts or pseudocode to plan — it saves time and reduces bugs!
