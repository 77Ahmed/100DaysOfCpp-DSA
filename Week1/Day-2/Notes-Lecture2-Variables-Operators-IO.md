### 📘 Day 2: C++ Basics – Syntax, Variables, Input, and Operators

## 🧠 What We Learned
---
### ✅ How Does Code Run?

Understanding how C++ works behind the scenes:

1. We **write code** in a text file using a language like C++.
2. A **compiler** (like `g++`) translates that human-readable code into machine language (binary).
3. The **CPU** runs that machine code and performs the instructions.

🧠 **Why it matters:** If there’s an error in your code, the compiler will try to help by pointing it out — understanding this process helps in debugging.

---

### ✅ Comments in C++

Comments are notes for **you** (and other programmers). They help explain what your code is doing. The **compiler ignores comments** completely.

// This is a single-line comment

/*
 This is a
 multi-line comment
*/


💡 **Pro Tip:** Always add comments to explain logic, especially for future reference.

---

### ✅ Variables

A **variable** stores data in memory. Think of it like a labeled box that holds something (a number, a letter, etc.).

#### Syntax:


int age = 21;
float price = 99.99;
char grade = 'A';


* `int` stores whole numbers.
* `float` stores decimal numbers (with less precision).
* `char` stores single characters (use single quotes `' '`).

🧠 **Why it's important:** C++ is a statically typed language, so you must declare the type before using a variable.

---

### ✅ Data Types

| Type     | Used For          | Example     |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| `int`    | Whole numbers     | 5, -2, 100  |
| `float`  | Decimal numbers   | 5.5, 3.14   |
| `double` | Larger decimals   | 99.9999999  |
| `char`   | Single characters | 'a', 'Z'    |
| `bool`   | True/false values | true, false |

💡 Tip: Use `double` when you need more precision than `float`.

---

### ✅ Type Conversion & Type Casting

---

### 🔄 Type Conversion (Implicit):

Automatically done by the compiler when types are compatible.

int a = 5;
float b = a;  // a becomes 5.0 as float

---

### 🔁 Type Casting (Explicit):

You manually convert one type to another.

float f = 5.9;
int x = (int)f;  // x becomes 5 (decimal is dropped)


🧠 Type casting is useful when you're doing calculations and need control over precision or performance.

---

### ✅ Basic Syntax in C++

Every C++ program needs a `main()` function. It’s the **starting point** of execution.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // your code here
    return 0;
}

---

### What each part means:

* `#include <iostream>` → lets us use input/output functions like `cin` and `cout`
* `using namespace std;` → avoids writing `std::cout` every time
* `int main()` → this is the entry point of the program
* `return 0;` → ends the program (0 means success)

---

### ✅ Taking Input in C++

To accept user input:

int a;
cin >> a;  // user types a number
cout << "Value is: " << a;

💡 Tip: Use `>>` to take input and `<<` to print output.

---

### ✅ Operators in C++

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

| Type       | Examples                | Description                         |         |                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | Math operations                     |         |                             |
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=`         | Assign and update variable values   |         |                             |
| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`    | Compare values (returns true/false) |         |                             |
| Logical    | `&&`, \`                |                                     | `, `!\` | Combine multiple conditions |

🧠 We'll explore each one in more detail as we build more complex logic (like conditions and loops).

---

### ✅ Unary Operators

Work on a single value (operand):

int a = 5;
a++;   // Post-increment → a becomes 6
--a;   // Pre-decrement → a becomes 5

These are useful for loops and counters.

---

### ✅ 🧮 Mini Practice: Sum of Two Numbers

Let’s apply what we learned:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2;

    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> num1 >> num2;

    int sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << "Sum is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}

🧠 **Try this yourself!** Change `+` to `-`, `*`, or `/` and see what happens.

---

### 🎯 Understanding the Logic

Let’s break this down with a real-world example:

🧍‍♂️ Imagine someone asks you:

> “How would you know if a number is positive or negative?”

You might answer:

* “If it’s more than 0, it’s positive.”
* “If it’s less than 0, it’s negative.”
* “If it’s exactly 0, then it’s just zero.”

That’s exactly what **pseudocode and flowcharts** help you do — they guide you in organizing your **thinking and logic** before writing actual code.

---

### 💡 Tip for Beginners

> ❗ **Never skip the planning phase.**
> Pseudocode and flowcharts might seem basic or boring, but they can save you **hours of debugging** later.

### ✅ Why Planning Matters

* You understand the **big picture** of your code
* You avoid getting stuck in syntax too early
* You start thinking like a **problem-solver**, not just a code typist
