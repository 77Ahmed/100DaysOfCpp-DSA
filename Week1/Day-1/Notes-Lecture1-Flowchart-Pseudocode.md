# 📘 Day 1: Flowchart & Pseudocode

## 🧠 What We Learned

### ✅ What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a visual way to represent the flow of a program or logic.

- Uses **shapes** like rectangles, diamonds, ovals  
- Easy to understand — even for non-programmers  
- Helps plan logic before coding  

#### 📌 Example from Real Life:
Imagine you're making tea. A flowchart for this might look like:

Start
Boil water
Add tea leaves
Wait for 2-3 minutes
Pour into cup
End


Just like that, we use flowcharts in programming to describe steps visually and clearly.

### 🧩 Common Flowchart Symbols

| Symbol        | Meaning                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 🟢 Oval        | Start or End of program          |
| 🟦 Rectangle   | Process or Action                |
| 🔷 Diamond     | Decision (if/else, condition)    |
| ➡️ Arrow       | Flow Direction                   |

🧠 **Pro Tip**: When you’re stuck writing code, draw a quick flowchart — it helps clear confusion and keeps you focused on logic.

### ✅ What is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode** is writing the logic of your code in plain English (or simple steps).

- Not real code — no need for exact syntax  
- Focuses on **logic, not formatting**  
- Helps beginners plan before writing actual code  

It’s like telling the computer what to do, step by step, without worrying about semicolons or curly brackets.

### 🧾 Example: Check if Number is Positive or Negative

Let’s write the pseudocode for this simple logic.

#### 📝 Pseudocode

Start
Ask the user to enter a number
Store the number in a variable
If the number is greater than 0
Display "The number is positive"
Else if the number is less than 0
Display "The number is negative"
Else
Display "The number is zero"
End

yaml
Copy code

### 🎯 Understanding the Logic

Let’s break this down with a real-world example:

🧍‍♂️ Imagine someone asks you:

> “How would you know if a number is positive or negative?”

You might answer:

- “If it’s more than 0, it’s positive.”  
- “If it’s less than 0, it’s negative.”  
- “If it’s exactly 0, then it’s just zero.”

That’s exactly what pseudocode and flowcharts help you do — they guide you in organizing your **thinking and logic** before writing actual code.

### 💡 Tip for Beginners

> ❗ **Never skip the planning phase.**  
> Pseudocode and flowcharts might seem basic or boring, but they can save you **hours of debugging** later.

#### ✅ Why Planning Matters

- You understand the **big picture** of your code  
- You avoid getting stuck in syntax too early  
- You start thinking like a **problem-solver**, not just a code typist
